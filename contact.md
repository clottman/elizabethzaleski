# Events
Join me for my launch!

Friday, February 27, 2026
Barley's Brewing Company, 467 N High St, Columbus OH, downstairs
6 p.m. to sometime before 10 p.m.
Free entrance, free food, unfree drinks

Staff from Prologue Books will be on site to sell copies of my book, which I will happily personalize for you with (1) unique but illegible inscriptions in my own handwriting, (2) less personalized but still fun sentiments in stamp form, or (3) traces of my DNA.

I'll also do my best to answer urgent audience questions drawn from a hat and would really love to run through a high-five tunnel of cheering fans at some point in the evening.
