# What this book is about:

Whether failing to restrain herself from trying to find greater meaning in roadkill, or to convince her dad that psychedelic mushrooms will not save his marriage, or to believably perform enthusiasm for her teammates, Elizabeth Zaleski is trying hard and failing spectacularly, and thankfully, she takes us along for the ride. 
Funny, intimate, and candid, <i>The Trouble with Loving Poets and Other Essays on Failure</i> debuts an exciting new voice. From growing up in a quirky family in rural northeast Ohio and attending a Mennonite high school as a lapsed Catholic to struggling to get over a particularly well-endowed lover and suffering intestinal calamity while searching for closure, Zaleski’s stories are at once captivating in their singularity and recognizable in their truthfulness. Fans of Tim Kreider and Sloane Crosley will appreciate Zaleski’s levity and wit as she takes aim at such time-honored institutions as pet ownership and gives clear-eyed dispatches from the no man’s land that is an HPV diagnosis.

As Zaleski writes, “If you’ll bear with me, we’re going to get a bit technical. And then, I promise, it will all start to matter.”

# But is it any good?

Yes. It's better than most books.

# Heaps of praise:

One of [12 Must Read Books of February 2026](https://chireviewofbooks.com/2026/02/02/12-must-read-books-of-february-2026/) according to the **Chicago Review of Books** (!)

I read an advanced copy of Elizabeth Zaleski's *The Troube with Loving Poets and Other Essays on Failure* based on a single newsletter sent out from her publisher at Belt, Anne Trubek. It's a delight to pick up a book by a writer totally unknown to you and finish it in a single day. **—Austin Kleon, NYT-bestselling author of Steal Like an Arist**

[Zaleski's] collection of essays on failure is charming and frank and disproves my hypothesis that publishers only release personal essay collections by the world’s dullest people. Zaleski: not dull! An oddball from rural Ohio with a crazy family who writes what I always wanted “alt lit” to be: the lucid prose of an original mind living an unconventional life. . . . It is the type of book destined to be ignored by the few remaining reviewing organs, and everything about it is hostile to any conceivable algorithm. So, vote with your dollars! **Molly Young, former book critic for the NYT, book recommender extraordinaire, and maker of many cool things**

Whether discussing linguistics or penis size, Zaleski is northeast Ohio’s answer to Samantha Irby, and her regional reflections on gender, family, and rural America have national importance. While most literary “bravery” depends on repression in order to question it, Zaleski starts outside cultural parameters and heads even farther away from them, dismantling the idea that intimate personal revelation is brave. Zaleski’s essays—and their genius wit—dare the genre to stop implicitly upholding norms and move instead toward actual liberation. This is the collection of groundbreaking feminist humor called for by our times. **—Allison Pitinii Davis, author of *Line Study of a Motel Clerk***

This book blew my mind. Elizabeth Zaleski’s intellect is a wondrous thing—as is her deadpan wit. And the force of her interest in things (in virtually everything) and relentless curiosity have resulted in a book that is by turns intellectual and bawdy, dead serious and hilarious—and sometimes all of these at once—as well as far-ranging, rollicking, provocative, continually thought-provoking, and *fun*. Who would expect to read an essay collection that contemplates free will, penis size, Christianity, car crashes, youth sports, romance, grammar and syntax, and the role of dogs in our lives (not an inclusive list)? When Zaleski tells the story of her (wacky) parents’ divorce and remarriage—to each other—or lovingly and patiently explains linguistics (in an essay that made me want to be a linguist) . . . or relates the saga of moving houses (23 times so far), it’s impossible not to be in her thrall. **—Michelle Herman, author of *If You Say So* and *Stories We Tell Ourselves***

Phenomenal. I was sad when it was over. **—Mom**
