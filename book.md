# What this book is about, sort of:

Whether failing to restrain herself from trying to find greater meaning in roadkill, or to convince her dad that psychedelic mushrooms will not save his marriage, or to believably perform enthusiasm for her teammates, Elizabeth Zaleski is trying hard and failing spectacularly, and thankfully, she takes us along for the ride. 
Funny, intimate, and candid, <i>The Trouble with Loving Poets and Other Essays on Failure</i> debuts an exciting new voice. From growing up in a quirky family in rural northeast Ohio and attending a Mennonite high school as a lapsed Catholic to struggling to get over a particularly well-endowed lover and suffering an intestinal calamity while searching for closure, Zaleski’s stories are at once captivating in their singularity and recognizable in their truthfulness. Fans of Tim Kreider and Sloane Crosley will appreciate Zaleski’s levity and wit as she takes aim at such time-honored institutions as pet ownership and gives clear-eyed dispatches from the no man’s land that is an HPV diagnosis.

As Zaleski writes, “If you’ll bear with me, we’re going to get a bit technical. And then, I promise, it will all start to matter.”

# But is it any good?
Yes. It's better than most books.

# Why would I want to read a book about failure? Isn't that depressing?
