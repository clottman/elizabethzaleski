My writing persona is like Allie Brosh with half the talent (I cannot draw) and Cheryl Strayed with half the fortitude (I overheat easily), shich is why this graphic essay, about antidepressants, contains illustrations drawn by people who are not me.

# Other projects

- <a href="https://greatfartsofliterature.com/">Great Farts of Literature</a>: I've somehow managed to read the majority of the Western canon (including all Charles Dickens's novels, if you count audtiobooks), but unfortunately, I didn't start paying attention to the really important stuff, namely passages about flatulence, until I was approaching middle age. With my friend Cassey Lottman, I have created a database to catalog the farts I can still remember and hopefully, with your help, to continue adding entries forever.
