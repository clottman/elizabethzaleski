My writing persona is like Allie Brosh with half the talent and Cheryl Strayed with half the fortitude (I can't draw, and I overheat very easily), which is why this graphic essay, about antidepressants, contains illustrations drawn by people who are not me.

# Other projects

- <a href="https://greatfartsofliterature.com/">Great Farts of Literature</a>: It was only after I'd already read the majority of the Western canon that I started paying attention to the really important stuff, namely passages about flatulence. With my friend Cassey Lottman, I have created a database in order to catalog the farts I can still remember and hopefully, with your help, continue adding entries forever.
- The Low Set, a band I was in when I lived in Lincoln, Nebraska
- Big Dickens List. I bought the domain name bigdickenslist.com with the goal of creating and publishing Dickens-themed listicles, but part of the problem with Dickens is that by the time you've finished the fifteenth novel, it's hard to remember what happened in the previous fourteen. Maybe someday it will turn into something.

# Free ideas you can steal (FIY) and calls for collaboration (CFC)
<b>CFC:</b> Are you a bra manufacturer? Do you want to create the biggest thing in boobs since the Wonderbra? SEND ME AN EMAIL. Okay, so we all know that breasts are rarely symmetrical. "They're sisters, not twins," the saying goes. But what if, like mine, your boobs are more like second cousins once removed? The only options are to split the difference or to buy for the bigger side and stuff the other one. Both of these options suck. But check this out: Some bras clasp in back, and some bras clasp in front. The necessary technology already exists! All we need to do is make bra <i>halves</i> so that you can order two different cup sizes with the same band width! And connect them . . . on both sides. THIS SHOULD EXIST. (I think it doesn't exist yet because many women would rather obscure their size difference than make each boob happy, but I'm telling you, this is a million-dollar idea.)

<b>CFC:</b> I am the future author of the board book *"Waiting for Godot" for Babies*, set to be released to the public in 2049, when *Godot* enters the public domain. I need an illustrator.

# Bonus material
Do you want to read even **more** of my thoughts about dogs? This section didn't make the final cut for "All the Dead Dogs," but Karina and her Peruvian pals deserve an audience:

<br>
Dogs have been living and working alongside humans for thousands of years, and our modern American version of dogdom is just one of many at play across the globe. In Cusco, Peru, dog ownership is casual, and huge packs of friendly stray dogs are the rule. As strays are sometimes poisoned, city dwellers have a custom of adorning their pets not with a collar but a shirt. When I visited Peru, the dogs of Cusco were endlessly fascinating to me because they were ubiquitous, untethered, and evidently quite happy. Of course this situation is not all roses, but Coppinger suggests these loosely affiliated, scavenging packs, living somewhat at the edges of human society, are the true modern version of the primordial dog. He thinks it unlikely that humans nabbed and restrained wolves and subsequently pacified them over generations. Rather, wolves with short flight tolerances beget wolves with shorter flight tolerances and over time domesticated themselves at the edge of our midden heap.

My friend Kelsey, an ecologist, agrees. She lived in Cusco for several years and fell in love with a dog at her field site outside the city. When she first encountered Karina in the mountains, she observed that Andean dogs ate copious amounts of feces, primarily the droppings of baby alpacas, which are rich in excreted milk proteins. But Kelsey also had difficulty keeping Karina from digging up human latrines, which earned her a nickname, bestowed affectionately: Boca Sucia.

<br>
Once, a woman I knew only tangentially, who owned a few huskies, passed a Chihuahua on the sidewalk. After the owner was out of earshot, she quipped, “That’s a cruel thing to do to a wolf.” Maybe, maybe not. The wolf, it seems, may have been complicit in its own transformation, with results neither human nor animal could have dreamed. The story of the trash dog can be read in multiple ways, in ways that demean dogs or in ways that unsettle the truism “There’s no such thing as bad dogs, only bad dog owners,” which reduces dogs to utter behaviorism. If dogs played a part in their own domestication, Donna Haraway argues, this fact has consequences for our notions of dominion, our Western belief that humans subdued animals in unilateral fashion. A different story reshuffles agency, casts multiple actors in these events: cue Karina and her shit-eating grin.
