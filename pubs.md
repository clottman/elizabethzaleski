# Online publications

- "Hung Up," originally published online at <i> The Missouri Review</i>, where it was also a 2024 Editors' Prize runner-up, which is possibly the highest award nearly conferred on an essay about penises: href="https://missourireview.com/hung-up-by-elizabeth-zaleski/"
- "The Trouble with Loving Poets" (titular essay in book), originally published online at <i>Hippocampus</i>: https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2017/02/the-trouble-with-loving-poets-by-elizabeth-zaleski/
- "Take Your Medicine," originally published online at <i>The Normal School</i>. My writing persona is like Allie Brosh with half the talent (I cannot draw!) and Cheryl Strayed with half the fortitude (I get hot easily!), which is why this graphic essay, about antidepressants, contains illustrations drawn by people who are not me: https://www.thenormalschool.com/blog/2018/9/17/take-your-medicine-by-elizabeth-zaleski-illustrations-by-kevin-abt-chad-miller.

I've read, like, the majority of the Western canon (including all Charles Dickens's novels), but unfortunately, I didn't start paying attention to the really important stuff, namely passages about flatulence, until I was approaching middle age. With my friend Cassey Lottman, I have created a database to catalog the farts I can still remember and to hopefully, with your help, add more entries forever. Check it out: <a href="https://greatfartsofliterature.com/">Great Farts of Literature</a>.
