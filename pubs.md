# Online publications (some of these are also in my book, hint hint)

- "Hung Up," originally published online at <i> The Missouri Review</i>, where it was also a 2024 Editors' Prize runner-up, which is possibly the highest award nearly conferred on an essay about penises: https://missourireview.com/hung-up-by-elizabeth-zaleski/
- "The Trouble with Loving Poets" (titular essay in book), originally published online at <i>Hippocampus</i>: https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2017/02/the-trouble-with-loving-poets-by-elizabeth-zaleski/
- "Take Your Medicine," originally published online at <i>The Normal School</i>. I like to describe my writing persona as like Allie Brosh with half the talent (I cannot draw!) or Cheryl Strayed with half the fortitude (I get hot easily!), which is why this graphic essay, about antidepressants, contains illustrations drawn by people who are not me: https://www.thenormalschool.com/blog/2018/9/17/take-your-medicine-by-elizabeth-zaleski-illustrations-by-kevin-abt-chad-miller. P.S. Do you know how I can reach Kevin Abt? I haven't been able to contact him for years, which is kind of normal for Kevin, but still.

# Other projects

I've read, like, the majority of the Western canon (including all the novels of Charles Dickens), but unfortunately for me, I didn't start paying attention to the really important stuff, namely passages about flatulence, until I was approaching middle age. With my friend Cassey Lottman, I have created a database to catalog the farts I can still remember and to hopefully, with your help, add to it forever. Check it out: <a href="https://greatfartsofliterature.com/">Great Farts of Literature</a>.
