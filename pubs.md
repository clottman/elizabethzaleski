# Other publications and projects

- "Hung Up" (also in the book) was originally published online at <i> The Missouri Review</i>, where it was also a 2024 Editors' Prize runner-up, which is possibly the highest award nearly conferred on an essay about penises: https://missourireview.com/hung-up-by-elizabeth-zaleski/
- "The Trouble with Loving Poets" (titular essay in the book, coincidentally features tits) was originally published online at <i>Hippocampus</i>, a pub that is still going strong and great to work with: https://hippocampusmagazine.com/2017/02/the-trouble-with-loving-poets-by-elizabeth-zaleski/
- "Take Your Medicine," originally published online at <i>The Normal School</i>. Sometimes I describe my writing persona as like Allie Brosh with half the talent (I cannot draw!) or Cheryl Strayed with half the fortitude (I get hot easily!), which is why this graphic essay contains illustrations drawn by people who are not me. This piece explores the many ways I've questioned, over more than twenty years, whether or not I should take antidepressants. I should: https://www.thenormalschool.com/blog/2018/9/17/take-your-medicine-by-elizabeth-zaleski-illustrations-by-kevin-abt-chad-miller. P.S. If you know where I can find Kevin Abt, let me know. I haven't been able to reach him for years, which is actually kind of normal for Kevin, but still.


I also am the curator of the <a href="https://greatfartsofliterature.com/">Great Farts of Literature</a>.
