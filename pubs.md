# Other publications and projects

- "Hung Up," originally published online as at <i> The Missouri Review</i>, where it was also a 2024 Editors' Prize runner-up, which is possibly the highest award nearly conferred on an essay about penises
- "The Trouble with Loving Poets," originally published online at <i>Hippocampus</i>, a pub that is still going strong with a team that is great to work with
- "Take Your Medicine," a graphic essay about antidepressants at <i>The Normal School</i>


I also am the curator of the <a href="https://greatfartsofliterature.com/">Great Farts of Literature</a>.
